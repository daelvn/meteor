A package manager exploration project for Lua. Last revised on **January 2021**.

## What?

It's too early to call this an alternative package manager for Lua, so I will be calling this a *package manager exploration project*. The point is looking at what LuaRocks does right, what it does wrong, what could improve and what is completely missing.

## Why?

LuaRocks is the choice package manager for Lua, and the one everyone uses for distributing packages. It's not a bad package manager, but it has its flaws.

## How?

This repository will mostly contain text for a while. First I would like to collect ideas, input from the community, see what we can do, what we should do, and things like that.

## Where?

Check out the concept, ideas and other things [here](//git.daelvn.com/meteor/).
