# ðŸŒ Meteor

A package manager exploration project for Lua.

## Why?

For many reasons! LuaRocks is the best tool we have, but not the best tool we could get. The CONCEPT.md file includes a list of the things that we could do better.

For now, this is just the beginning, getting into it, exploring different options and systems, creating primitive tools and systems. Nothing ready for production.

## When?

There is no planned project development, but rather, this is just a collection of ideas.
