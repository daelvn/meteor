# ðŸŒ Meteor

A package manager exploration project for Lua and MoonScript.

## Why?

For many reasons! LuaRocks is the best tool we have, but not the best tool we could get. The CONCEPT.md file includes a list of the things that we could do better (in a very vulgar manner, though).

For now, this is just the beginning, getting into it, exploring different options and systems, creating primitive tools and systems. Nothing ready for production.
