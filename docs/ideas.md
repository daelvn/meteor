## Ideas

These are the ideas that, on top of fixing LuaRocks' perceived flaws, Meteor should implement.

### Windows support

As much as it pains me, Windows **must** be supported.

### Maintainability

The source code should be accessible, maintainable, open and self-documented to ensure that it's accessible for other collaborators, contributors and maintainers.
